# Flipping Cards

When I set out to develop a project that uses flash cards, I knew that I wanted to have cards that would flip when clicked.  I had not worked much with animations other than just some simple transitions and hover effects.  I will be breaking down the article into sections that address each of the stages I worked through to get the cards working and the obstacles that I came across at each step.  

This article will be broken up into 2 parts.  Part 1 will cover how I went about building the cards and getting them to flip.  In Part 2 I will cover how I went about putting content in the cards.
