# Welcome to JS Flashcards!

Jan 16, 2020 - The app is currently a work in progress. I have been working on it consistently the last few weeks, but I am planning to step back a bit as I make some time to work on other projects. I plan to continue to add content on a weekly basis and add more sections.

## Why I built the site

I built the site for 2 reasons.

1. The first reason was to create a Vue project that I thought up on my own.  This has allowed me to practice both my Vue and general front end skills.  

2. The second reason was was to create flashcards to help other people learn JS while also solidifying my own learning. The process of trying to figure out what and how much content to put on the cards has been a great exercise, strengthening my own understanding. It's definitely true that one of the best ways to make sure that you understand something is to try and teach it to someone else.

## Make it your own

This project is copyrighted under a MIT license. Please feel free to use any of the code or content in your own projects. I chose to use Vue, but you could use any front end framework to make something similar. The following is a list of some pieces that you could use in your own project.

1. Nav bar (used Flexbox and auto margin to move an element all the way to the left)
2. Drop down mobile nav bar
3. flipping cards
  a. how to get the content on the cards and then animate
  b. logic so that only one flips when clicked
4. Footer - style svg buttons on hover
5. Modals - show and hide on click
6. buttons - click buttons on flipping card without the card flipping (used @click.stop to stop propogation)
7. Style with Tailwind CSS.  Extend theme in tailwind.config.js
