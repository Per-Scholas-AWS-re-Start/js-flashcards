# JS Flashcards Roadmap

## This document is a work in process

### This is a place that I will be putting all of the issues and bugs to fix as well as ideas for new features

If you find any bugs or have a suggestion for a feature you would like to see, you can email me at jamie@mccarville.dev

### Issues to fix

#### Modals

- stop the body in the background from scrolling when the modal is open
- make the modal content scrollable if there is overflow
- improve accessibility of the modals
- check out article on CSS Tricks by Chris Coyier

### Improvements and Features

Add and improve transitons

Split the app into sections

- basics
- intermediate
- advanced
- other sections as needed

Add search functionality

Add practice questions for each section

- have to decide whether to have them on the site or link to them somewhere else that they are interactive
- would be great to have them work similar to freeCodeCamp, with an interactive area that has tests that pass/fail and hints
- could also have unit/section ending projects that are a little more involved - same format as the freeCodeCamp projects where you build it in Codepen and then apply the tests

Hacktoberfest

- create an opportunity for people to submit questions/exercises

check notes in Notion to add to this list
